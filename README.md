# TREE 
When two people, represented by the clouds in the sky, touch hands together the clouds rain onto the ground. From the rained on spot a tree grows.

The Recursive Tree contains an ArrayList of RecursiveBranches, each of which creates a new set of branches. When the branches are created then the LeafPositions are added to an array, based on each branch. The leaf positions are then shuffled.Then the tree draws each branch in order, drawing a whole branch and its sub-branches before moving onto the next.

After all branches are drawn it begins to draw the leaves. Leaves are added to leaved at a rate that depends of the distance between the two individuals in the space. As two people lift their arms at similar rates, the leaves begin to turn yellow and eventually fall off the tree.
